##The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that leverages modern JavaScript frameworks like React.js or Vue.js to provide an intuitive, responsive editing experience. It supports multi-user collaboration, where changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all participants through WebSocket-based communication (Socket.IO/Y.js).
